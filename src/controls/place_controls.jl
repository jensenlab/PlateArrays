    place_controls(wells::BitMatrix,P::Int,N::Int;solver::String="exchange",objective::String="hybrid",kwargs...)

Place optimal controls for detecting errors in microplate experiments

# Arguments 
- `wells`: A BitMatrix mask indicating the shape and active wells, use `trues(n,m)` for a full n x m plate.
- `P`: The integer number of positive controls
- `N`: The integer number of negative controls 

# Keyword Arguments 
- `solver`: The algorithm used to place the controls. There are currently two solvers available: 
    1. exchange (default): 
    2. MILP : 
- `objective`: The objective the solver uses to score plate array candidates. 
    1. minimax -> Minimize the maximum distance in wells from an active well to its nearest control. 
    2. LHS -> Find an approximate latin hypercube sample of the available wells in the plate. 
    3. hybrid (default) -> a weighted combination of both criteria
